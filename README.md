Let's use [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) to build an Uber clone minus the middleman. 


### Resources

* [Holochain developer portal](https://developer.holochain.org/) - Docs, tutorial, API
* [Holochain project map](http://map.holohackers.org/) - See Unter, Corridor, Maps


### Contributing

Pull requests welcome. If you're at the Austin hackathon, see me (Chris D) for repo write access.


### Questions
* Should agent.txt and priv.key remain in .gitignore? Does someone cloning this repo need to add/generate their own? How?
